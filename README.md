With a passion for technology, problem solving and collaborative working, I am keen to start my new career as a developer and enhance my skills, while meeting some cool people along the way! Recent graduate of Le Wagon's full-stack web development course and couldn't be more proud and grateful to the Le Wagon team! #697!</p>
